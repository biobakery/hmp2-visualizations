	<h2><b>Your IBD Multi&#39;omics microbiome</b></h2>

	<p>Welcome!</p>
	<p>Thank you for participating in the IBD Multi'omics
	project. Here, you can explore the information that the
	project has collected so far about your gut microbes and those
	of the other project participants. This page provides a
	summary of your gut microbial information collected over the
	course of the study. It also contextualizes your gut in the
	larger population of all IBD Multi'omics participants. Your
	results contribute greatly to our understanding of Crohn's
	disease and ulcerative colitis, and we hope that the project
	will help to generate new treatments for these conditions.</p>

	<p>The human gut microbiota is one of the most complex
	reservoirs of microbial diversity, hosting hundreds of
	bacterial species. Large groups of related species are called
	phyla, and only a few of these are common in the human
	microbiome:
	  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmicutes"
	     target="_blank"> Firmicutes
	  </a>,
	  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteroidetes"
	     target="_blank"> Bacteroidetes
	  </a>,
	 and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinobacteria"
	 target="_blank">Actinobacteria</a> represent about 75% of the
	 organisms within the gut.</p>
	<p></p>

	    This diagram represents the proportions of different groups
	    (phyla) of microbes in your gut from to most recent samples
	    you've provided. For security and privacy reasons, we're not
	    allowed to label these samples with specific dates, so up to the
	    12 most recent samples are shown. This allows you to see how
	    your own microbial community varies over time.

	  <p>This diagram shows all stool samples collected from all
	    participants in the IBD Multi'omics project. Each dot
	    represents a single sample, and the distance between
	    points indicates how dissimilar they are. The closer
	    together two samples' points appear, the more similar
	    their microbial communities are. Your samples as collected
	    over time are marked in green, so you can see how your own
	    gut microbiome changes over time and in relation to other
	    participants' guts.</p>

	      This bar graph shows the average abundance of each major
	      group
	      (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylum">phylum</a>)
	      of microbes in your microbiome as compared to their
	      averages over all other participants in the study. It's
	      normal for everyone to have big differences in our
	      microbiomes, both between different people and in our
	      own guts from day to day, even in health.

	      This plot shows the range of how much each food item is
	      consumed by all study participants. The amount that you
	      indicated during your most recent, short questionnaire
	      delivered with your latest sample is marked with 'â—Š'.
